## Projects Included
### AverageScore_Grade
``Description`` This program calculates the average of three input scores, validates them within the range of 0 
to 20, and assigns a grade based on the calculated average. After calculation, it displays both the average score 
and its corresponding grade.  
  - "Excellent" if the average score is 16 or above
  - "Good" if the average score is between 14 and 16 (including 14)
  - "Fair" if the average score is between 12 and 14 (including 12)
  - "Poor" if the average score is between 10 and 12 (including 10)
  - "Very poor" if the average score is below 10

``Files`` The files for this project are in the folder AverageScore_Grade. 
- averagescore_grade.py is the file that contains the code
- averagescore_grade.txt contains the algorithm in English
- notes_moyennes.txt contains the algorithm in French

### Revenue_Calculator
``Description`` This program calculates revenue based on the total number of units sold and the price per unit.
Additionally, it lets users input a currency symbol and displays both the symbol and the revenue, rounded to two decimal places.

``Files`` The file that contains the code for this project is revenue_calculator.py  
You can find it in the directory Revenue_Calculator 

### Circle_Area
``Description`` This program effectively calculates and displays the area of a circle with two decimal places
while handling cases where the user enters a non-positive radius.

``Files`` The file that contains the code for this project is circle_area.py  
You can find it in the directory Circle_Area

### Kitty_Art
``Description`` This Python program generates an ASCII art representation of a kitty,
featuring indentation for a neater and more structured appearance.

``Files`` The files for this project are in the directory Kitty_Art  
- kitty_art.py contains the code
- Kitty.png is the screenshot  

### Basic_Calculator
``Description`` This program is a simple calculator that allows a user to perform basic arithmetic operations 
on two numbers. It interacts with the user to input two numbers (A and B) and the desired mathematical operation (Op),
and then it calculates and displays the result.  

``Files`` The file that contains the code for this project is basic_calculator.py  
You can find it in the directory Basic_Calculator

### Math_Operations
``Description`` This program allows users to perform various mathematical operations on two input numbers.
With this interactive tool, you can quickly calculate the sum, difference, product, average, integer quotient,
real quotient, and modulo of two numbers.  

``Files`` The file that contains the code for this project is math_operations.py  
You can find it in the directory Math_Operations 

### Number_Factorial
``Description`` The factorial of a number N is the product of all positive integers from 1 to N.  
This  program calculates factorials for user-entered numbers, providing clear messages for various input scenarios,
including zero, negative, and very large numbers (above 170). It's beginner-friendly and does not utilize functions.  
However, please note that it does not handle non-integer inputs.  

``Files`` The file that contains the code for this project is number_factorial.py  
You can find it in the directory Number_Factorial  

### Text_Composer
``Description`` This program allows users to compose text by entering single characters interactively. Characters
are collected one by one, and to conclude input, users can enter a period ('.'), which will not be displayed in the
final output.  
This program is designed for simplicity and basic text composition. It may not be suited for users who need to enter 
larger amounts of text quickly. And it doesn't include advanced error handling features.  

``Files`` The file that contains the code for this project is text_composer.py  
You can find it in the directory Text_Composer  

### Prime_Number
``Description`` This program determines whether a user-entered integer is a prime number or a composite number. Prime numbers are defined as positive integers greater than 1 that have exactly two distinct positive divisors: 1 and themselves. This program calculates the number of divisors for the entered integer and uses this count to make the determination.  If the user enters a non-integer, it will provide an error message.  

``Files`` The file that contains the code for this project is prime_number.py  
You can find it in the directory Prime_Number  

### Multiplication_Table
``Description`` This program generates a multiplication table from 0 to 10 for user-input integers. Please note that it does not include error handling for invalid input.  

``Files`` The file that contains the code for this project is multiplication_table.py  
You can find it in the directory Multiplication_Table  

### Compare_Signs
``Description`` This program determines whether two numbers entered by the user have the same sign, opposite signs, or if one of them is zero.

``Files`` The file that contains the code for this project is compare_signs.py  
You can find it in the directory Compare_Signs

### Swap_By_Sign
``Description`` This program swaps the values of two numbers entered by the user if they have the same sign; otherwise, it places the sum of the two in the first number and their product in the second.

``Files`` The file that contains the code for this project is swap_by_sign.py
You can find it in the directory Swap_By_Sign 

### Copy_Bill
``Description`` This program calculates the cost of photocopies, and displays the total bill in Moroccan Dirhams (MAD). It calculates the cost according to the following rules:
- If the number of copies is 10 or less, each copy costs 0.30 MAD.
- If the number of copies is between 11 and 30 (inclusive), the first 10 copies cost 0.30 MAD each, and the rest cost 0.25 MAD each.
- If the number of copies is over 30, the first 10 copies cost 0.30 MAD each, the next 20 cost 0.25 MAD each, and the remaining copies cost 0.20 MAD each.

``Files``  The file that contains the code for this project is copy_bill.py  
You can find it in the directory Copy_Bill

### Age_Category
``Description`` This program prompts the user to enter a child's age and categorizes it into one of the following age groups:  "Youngster" (6-7 years old), "Pupil" (8-9 years old), "Junior" (10-11 years old), or "Cadet" (12 years and older).  
If the entered age doesn't fall into any of these categories, it informs the user that the child doesn't belong to any specified category.

``Files`` The file that contains the code for this project is age_category.py  
  You can find it in the directory Age_Category

### Quadratic_Equation
``Description`` This program prompts the user to input the coefficients (a, b, and c) of a quadratic equation. It calculates the discriminant (d) and then determines and displays the solutions of the equation, rounded to three decimal places.

``Files`` The file that contains the code for this project is quadratic_equation.py  
You can find it in the directory Quadratic_Equation
