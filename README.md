### Population_Comparison
``Description`` This program calculates and displays the number of years it takes for Agadir's population to surpass Marrakech's. Given the initial populations of Marrakech and Agadir, along with their respective growth rates. The population of the city of Marrakech is 1,000,000 inhabitants, and it increases by 50,000 inhabitants per year. The population of the city of Agadir is 500,000 inhabitants, and it increases by 8% per year.

``Files``  The file that contains the code for this project is population_comparison.py  
You can find it in the directory Population_Comparison

### Formula_Sequence
``Description`` This program prompts the user to enter an integer 'n'. It then calculates and prints the value of U(n) using a recursive formula, where U(0) = 6, and U(n+1) = 4 * U(n) + 10.

``Files`` The file that contains the code for this project is formula_sequence.py  
You can find it in the directory Formula_Sequence

### Fibonacci_Sequence
``Description`` This program prompts the user to enter an integer greater than or equal to 2, and it generates and displays the Fibonacci sequence, stopping just before reaching the specified integer.
