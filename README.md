# Projects Included

### Project 1: Average Test Scores Calculator 

*Description*: This program allows you to input three test scores (ranging from 0 to 20) for a student. It calculates the average score and 
assigns a grade based on the average:
  - "Excellent" for scores above 16
  - "Good" for scores between 14 and 16
  - "Fair" for scores between 12 and 14
  - "Poor" for scores between 10 and 12
  - "Very poor" for scores below 10

*Files*: I am currently working on creating the necessary files for this project.
