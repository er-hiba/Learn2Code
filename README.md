## Projects Included
### AverageScore_Grade
*Description*: This program calculates the average of three input scores, validates them within the range of 0 
to 20, and assigns a grade based on the calculated average. It then displays both the average score and the corresponding grade.
  - "Excellent" if the average score is 16 or above
  - "Good" if the average score is between 14 and 16 (including 14)
  - "Fair" if the average score is between 12 and 14 (including 12)
  - "Poor" if the average score is between 10 and 12 (including 10)
  - "Very poor" for scores below 10

*Files*: The files for this project are in the folder AverageScore_Grade. 
- AverageScore_Grade.py is the file that contains the code
- AverageScore_Grade.txt contains the algorithm in English
- Notes_Moyennes.txt contains the algorithm in French
