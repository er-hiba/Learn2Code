# Learn2Code Repository
Welcome to my repository where I document my journey of learning how to code. This repository contains various simple coding projects I'm working on. 
Whether you're new to programming or looking for interesting beginner-level projects, you might find something here that piques your interest.

## Getting Started
To get started with any project in this repository, please follow these steps:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:  
git clone https://github.com/er-hiba/learn2code.git
2. Navigate to a project's directory using the command:  
cd learn2code/project-name
3. Once you're in a project directory, follow the project-specific instructions provided in the project's README or code files.

Repeat steps 2 and 3 for each project you're interested in.

That's it! You're now ready to explore and work with the projects in this repository.

## Projects Included
### AverageScore_Grade
``Description`` This program calculates the average of three input scores, validates them within the range of 0 
to 20, and assigns a grade based on the calculated average. After calculation, it displays both the average score 
and its corresponding grade.  
  - "Excellent" if the average score is 16 or above
  - "Good" if the average score is between 14 and 16 (including 14)
  - "Fair" if the average score is between 12 and 14 (including 12)
  - "Poor" if the average score is between 10 and 12 (including 10)
  - "Very poor" if the average score is below 10

``Files`` The files for this project are in the folder AverageScore_Grade. 
- averagescore_grade.py is the file that contains the code
- averagescore_grade.txt contains the algorithm in English
- notes_moyennes.txt contains the algorithm in French

### Revenue_Calculator
``Description`` This program calculates revenue based on the total number of units sold and the price per unit.
Additionally, it lets users input a currency symbol and displays both the symbol and the revenue, rounded to two decimal places.

``Files`` The file that contains the code for this project is revenue_calculator.py  
You can find it in the directory Revenue_Calculator 

### Circle_Area
``Description`` This program effectively calculates and displays the area of a circle with two decimal places
while handling cases where the user enters a non-positive radius.

``Files`` The file that contains the code for this project is circle_area.py  
You can find it in the directory Circle_Area

### Kitty_Art
``Description`` This Python program generates an ASCII art representation of a kitty,
featuring indentation for a neater and more structured appearance.

``Files`` The files for this project are in the directory Kitty_Art  
- kitty_art.py contains the code
- Kitty.png is the screenshot  

### Basic_Calculator
``Description`` This program is a simple calculator that allows a user to perform basic arithmetic operations 
on two numbers. It interacts with the user to input two numbers (A and B) and the desired mathematical operation (Op),
and then it calculates and displays the result.  

``Files`` The file that contains the code for this project is basic_calculator.py  
You can find it in the directory Basic_Calculator

### Math_Operations
``Description`` This program allows users to perform various mathematical operations on two input numbers.
With this interactive tool, you can quickly calculate the sum, difference, product, average, integer quotient,
real quotient, and modulo of two numbers.  

``Files`` The file that contains the code for this project is math_operations.py  
You can find it in the directory Math_Operations 

### Number_Factorial
``Description`` The factorial of a number N is the product of all positive integers from 1 to N.  
This  program calculates factorials for user-entered numbers, providing clear messages for various input scenarios,
including zero, negative, and very large numbers (above 170). It's beginner-friendly and does not utilize functions.  
However, please note that it does not handle non-integer inputs.  

``Files`` The file that contains the code for this project is number_factorial.py  
You can find it in the directory Number_Factorial  

### Text_Composer
``Description`` This program allows users to compose text by entering single characters interactively. Characters
are collected one by one, and to conclude input, users can enter a period ('.'), which will not be displayed in the
final output.  
This program is designed for simplicity and basic text composition. It may not be suited for users who need to enter 
larger amounts of text quickly. And it doesn't include advanced error handling features.  

``Files`` The file that contains the code for this project is text_composer.py  
You can find it in the directory Text_Composer
